# Week 1 – August 2025 Learning Log

## Day 1 – AWS CLI Setup
- Installed AWS CLI v2 on Ubuntu.
- Configured with `aws configure`.
- Verified with `aws s3 ls`.
- Linked project: [AWS CLI Setup](../projects/aws-cli-setup.md)

## Day 2 – GitHub SSH Access
- Generated SSH key, added to GitHub.
- Verified with `ssh -T git@github.com`.
- Linked project: [GitHub SSH](../projects/github-ssh.md)

## Day 3 – User Management
- Created users with `adduser` and `usermod`.
- Added groups for developers and finance.
- Linked project: [User Management](../projects/user-management.md)
- Script: [user-provision.sh](../scripts/user-provision.sh)

## Day 4 – Nginx Web Server
- Installed Nginx with `apt install nginx`.
- Served “Hello World” from `/var/www/html`.
- Linked project: [Nginx Server](../projects/nginx-server.md)
- Runbook: [Restart Nginx](../runbooks/restart-nginx.md)

## Day 5 – Backup Script
- Wrote a bash script to back up `/etc`.
- Compressed into `/backups/etc-<date>.tar.gz`.
- Script: [backup-etc.sh](../scripts/backup-etc.sh)

## Day 6 – Cronjob for Backup
- Automated backup script with cronjob (daily @ 2am).
- Verified cron logs.

## Day 7 – Runbook Documentation
- Created runbook for restoring backups.
- Linked runbook: [Restore Backup](../runbooks/restore-backup.md)

  ## Day 27–28: SSH Security Audit
- Ran grep commands on /var/log/auth.log to detect failed SSH attempts.
- Observed multiple "invalid user" probes (`jesus, postgres, samba, server, sales`) from different IP addresses.
- Confirmed **no successful login** for those accounts (`[preauth]` stage = blocked before auth).
- Learned to use grep with:
  - `-c` to count
  - `-E` for OR patterns
  - awk + sort + uniq for IP ranking
- Wrote small script (`ssh-brute-report`) to generate daily summary.
- Lesson learned: brute-force attempts are common; must enforce key-only SSH and Fail2ban.
