# Personal SysAdmin / DevOps Logbook

This repository is my **daily timeline journal** of learning, practicing, and implementing Linux, AWS, and DevOps skills.  

I use this to:
- Document commands, processes, and fixes I learn each day.
- Build a reference I can search later.
- Show progress (beginner â†’ mid â†’ expert tasks).

Structure:
- `logs/` â†’ Daily timeline notes by month
- `cheatsheets/` â†’ Quick reference (Linux, Git, AWS, Docker)
- `projects/` â†’ Detailed write-ups of larger projects

---
âœ… Rule: If I type more than 3 commands â†’ I log it here.
