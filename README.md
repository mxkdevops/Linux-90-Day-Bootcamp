# Personal SysAdmin / DevOps Logbook

This repository is my **daily timeline journal** of learning, practicing, and implementing Linux, AWS, and DevOps skills.  

I use this to:
- Document commands, processes, and fixes I learn each day.
- Build a reference I can search later.
- Show progress (beginner → mid → expert tasks).

Structure:
- `logs/` → Daily timeline notes by month
- `cheatsheets/` → Quick reference (Linux, Git, AWS, Docker)
- `projects/` → Detailed write-ups of larger projects

---
✅ Rule: If I type more than 3 commands → I log it here.
